% REPLACE THE dummy DEFINITIONS

% if you know this you can make a choice that will never lose (but might draw);
no_repeat([]) ->
    paper;  % arbitrary starter
no_repeat([Last|_]) ->
    % play a move that we know won't lose against not-Last
    % if:
    % Last == rock
    % then next will be:
    % (paper OR scissors)
    % and a not-losing move against (paper OR scissors) is:
    % scissors
    % why scissors? well, if it's - say - rock then opponent's paper will win.
    % if it's - say - paper then opponent's scissors will win.
    % so basically we play the WINNING or strongest move of the two non-Last moves

    % APPROACH
    % [1] remove Last from list of all possible moves
    % [2] return strongest of remaining two moves from [1]
    
    % [1]
    [Next1, Next2] = lists:filter(fun (X) when X == Last -> false; (X) -> true end, [rock, paper, scissors]),   % [rock, paper, scissors] feels a bit hard-codingy
